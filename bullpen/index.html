                <h1>Welcome to Bullpen Scheduling!</h1>
                <h2>This web app is designed to facilitate a central volunteer assigning flex volunteers to teams.</h2>
                <p>On the top right you'll see the "Teams Setup" page.  On that page you can add/delete teams and add/delete regular volunteers.  A "regular" volunteer 
                    is a volunteer who regularly volunteers for a particular team/service.  You'll find an "add regulars" button on the main page where you can add 
                    all regular volunteers with one click.</p>
                    <p>On the main page, you'll be able to add flex volunteers.  Adding or removing volunteers on this page does not add them to the regulars roster.</p>
                    <p>Because this is your first time here, I've loaded some sample data for you.</p>
                    <h2 id="warning">This application uses local storage!</h2>
                    <p>This application uses local storage, which means that all teams data is saved to the local device.  If you update all of your teams and rosters on one device and go to use
                        another device when volunteers show up, the new device will not know any of the teams or roster info.  If you clear your browser's cashe and temporary internet files, the device will forget
                        all your teams data as well.  The benefit is that this application can be used 
                        simultaneously on many devices without having to do any registration process.  
                    </p>
                    <p>If you run into any issues with the application, please contact Matt Bilyeu at matt.bilyeu1@gmail.com</p>
